  1. Given the time - I created this website in low fidelity to try and achive functionality and layout. 

  2. Slideshow: It was a very complex slideshow and I ended up having to opt for a cookie cutter snippet.

  3. The website is responsive and has 3 breakpoints. 

  4. Fonts: I don't own and currently can't afford to purchase this font. 

  5. Buttons: All buttons and links have a hover state. 

  6. Navigation Hamburger: Displays once on mobile

  7. Created the section scroll on click via the down arrow under the social links on the bottom left. 

  8. Created the hover state/animation for the Key Speakers section.
